## Challenge 3

This challenge focuses on preparing an assessment of the anticipated cloud costs.  You will be provided with a spreadsheet of the customer’s real estate.

This Challenge focus on preparing an assessment using Azure Migrate.  A pre-populated Excel file ([Azure Migrate import template – Migration VF.xls](/student%20content/Azure%20Migrate%20import%20template%20-%20Migration%20VF.csv)) contains information about Contoso’s current digital estate.  Your team will need to create an Azure Migrate assessment to gain an understanding of what the estimated costs would look like post-migration.
The final assessment will contribute to the team’s business case.  Spend some time reviewing the results of the Azure Migrate assessment.

**Learning objectives:**

- Take inventory of your digital estate
- Understanding cloud costs
