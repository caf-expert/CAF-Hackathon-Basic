## Overview

This CAF Hackathon enables attendees to understand and get familiar on how the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure (CAF) can be applied with their customers.  This hackathon walks through the Define Strategy and Plan phases of the CAF to support attendees in leading a client engagement that is considering moving their digital assets to Azure.
 
This CAF Hackathon simulates a real-world scenario where a company has multiple datacenters with hundreds of line-of-business applications.  The company is looking at migrating and modernizing their current digital estate to Microsoft’s cloud platform.  Since the company has a global presence, they need support in optimizing their current solutions and processes so that their multiple business groups can focus on their core business.

During the hackathon, attendees will focus on learning how to leverage the CAF in guiding a customer through starting on a successful cloud adoption journey.  Attendees will have the opportunity to gain hands-on experience by creating a business case, building a cloud adoption plan, and leveraging multiple cloud assessment tools to support a customer with justifying their cloud adoption.  

By the end of the CAF Hackathon, attendees will have built a cloud adoption plan that they can use to present to a customer’s C-Suite to justify adopting the cloud. The purpose of this exercise is to provide you with the tools and understanding that will complement the conversations attendees may be having with their customers.
